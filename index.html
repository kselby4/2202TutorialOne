            <h4 class="sectionText">I am currently pursuing a Bachelor of Software Engineering (B.Eng) at Western University, expecting to graduate in 2026. I have a strong academic background, consistently achieving Honor Roll/Dean's list status throughout high school and university. Beyond academics, I am an active member of the Women in Engineering Executive Team, where I oversee mentorship programs and plan events. Additionally, I have valuable work experience as a Development Intern at Berkeley Payments, where I developed automation tools and gained proficiency in Node.js, SQL, AWS, Git, and Terraform. Furthermore, I enjoy partaking in various sports in my free time.</h4>
